## Pricing

- [Pricing Design](https://abookapart.com/products/pricing-design): Dan Mall
  explains how to earn more, by understanding what goes into a price (and why
  hourly rates don’t work) and what your clients really want—and are willing to
  pay for. Learn the right questions to ask and when, and ways to turn client
  requirements into numbers, with a real-world example from Dan’s agency.
  Whether you’re running a shop or going solo, this is a book you can’t afford
  to miss.

This book provides other resources that look very good:

- [Pricing For Profit](https://www.amazon.com/Pricing-Profit-Command-Products-Services-ebook/dp/B002QMKT1U):
  Many small business owners are trapped by industry pricing and market
  misconceptions, when they could be compensated for the true value of the
  product or service being offered. The low price they feel compelled to offer
  limits their ability to generate profits which, in turn, slows their response
  to changing customer needs. The good news is that a business can command
  almost any price it chooses by focusing on the value not the cost to the
  customer.

- [Are we in control of our own decisions?](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_asks_are_we_in_control_of_our_own_decisions).
  TED talk by Dan Ariely. The Economist example at the end is very illuminating,
  and quite relevant to pricing design.
